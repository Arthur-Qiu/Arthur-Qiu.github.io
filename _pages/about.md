**I'm seeking a future PhD position in 2020!**

My research interests: Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN), Computer Vision(Image Synthesis, Super-Resolution, Style Transfer). To concentrate on research, I gap one year now and will go back to school next year (after summer). Now I am finding a summer research intern position (prefer to GAN related topics) for future PHD application.
